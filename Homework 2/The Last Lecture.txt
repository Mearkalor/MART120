I do agree with a lot of what was said in the Last Lecture. I think that going through life does require obstacles, hardships, and problems, because making it out of those issues is a vital aspect of growing. I think that finding value in life is so important. Living purposefully is something that is attainable for anyone, because purpose is subjective. Finding purpose is within yourself, strictly contributing to the outside world isn't necessarily purpose. I think that many people misunderstand finding purpose as finding how you can contribute to society, but I think hat finding purpose and achieving dreams does not have to confine to being a cog in the great machine. Purpose is whatever makes you feel like life is worth living, maybe its art, music, writing, travelling, and much more.
