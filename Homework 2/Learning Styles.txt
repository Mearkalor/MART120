I do think that learning styles affect the way we learn, because brains differ in the way they are wired. Some people process information in different ways than others. And sometimes its harder for certain people to process information. For example, I process information in a much different way than my brother, who has ADD. I can process information quicker, and in a more technical manner. My brother on the other hand, had trouble with low stimulation information and requires visuals and more stimulating forms of information exchanges.
