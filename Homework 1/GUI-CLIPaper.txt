Graphical User Interfaces are visual computer elements through designs, windows, buttons, icons, and menus. Operating systems use graphical interfaces like windows, appleOS, and many other softwares across devices. These interfaces are visual, and usually function with a point and click interface. Visual interfaces make navigating software much easier to digest and requires less knowledge of commands and functions.

A Command Line Interface is a way to interact with a computer in a more direct way, substituting ease of use with more complex abilities. Commands are typed into consoles, instead of using buttons, menus, and other graphical interfaces. With Command line interfaces, users are granted much more power over computer recourses, and allows for precise control. Command Prompt, Linux, and more are considered common programs for command line interfaces.
