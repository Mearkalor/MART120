        <h2>Short Story</h2>
        <body>
            There is an urban legend that been told of those who have tread where they should not. Macrohouses and corporate megastructures are rumored to have immeasurable complexes of intertwining infrastructure, running deep into the stomach of the underground. It is said that those who take a wrong turn can end up in endless shaded, empty halls with no exit, accompanied by cavernous blank offices with no end. Trapped wandering for what seems like miles through decaying rooms with ceilings stained by unknown leakage, overwhelmed with the suffocating smell of dust and mold. No one knows what these rooms were meant for, but we do know that whatever their purpose had been, it was never supposed to be discovered. If you ever take a few wrong corners, it’s best to turn around before you never come back.
